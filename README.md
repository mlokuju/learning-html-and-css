# Starting out into the field of web development 

First I must know certain technologie, like HTML & CSS

**HTML** Hyper Text Markup Language

- According to w3schools, HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages
- It describes the structure of a web page
- It tells the browser how to display the content


```html
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is how a HTML file should look like<title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The body is where all your HTML code / web page structure should be written</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
